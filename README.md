This "game" was made in less than one day for the [first day of the Pass the game challenge 2023](https://itch.io/jam/day-1).

It is made with Bevy Engine.

I will not continue it and not comment it more on purpose, see the rules of the jam.

It is far from complete, not properly structured, and has many bugs. Sorry about that.

Day 2 here: https://github.com/Vrixyz/pass-the-game-air-oki_day2
